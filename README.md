# Ionic Autocomplete Searchbar

This template shows how to use Ionic to create a text input that acts as an autocomplete input that filters a list of items.
It uses a contacts json file to load its items to the app and shows it in a list on the main view.
The autocomplete input let you filter the contacts list by name.
It's inspired by the Telegram and Whatsapp UX.
